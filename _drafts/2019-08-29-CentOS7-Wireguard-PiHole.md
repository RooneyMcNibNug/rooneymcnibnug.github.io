# A CentOS VPS with Wireguard and PiHole

I've evangilized how great I think both [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) and [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) are [in a previous post of mine](https://rooneymcnibnug.github.io/privacy/2019/05/15/rooney-pihole.html), where I explained how useful a combination of the two can be as a somehwat artisinal Virtual Private Server. I personally like this setup because it gives you full sysadmin access to a VPS service (at a low cost), something impossible to get with most managed VPN providers out there.
