# 2019's FOIAs - Year in Review and Reflections

This past year has definitely been the most active for me in regards to public records requests, so I thought I would spend a bit
of time on New Year's Eve to go over some of the details of my year with FOIA, some reflections of things that wen't well and things
I wish I'd done a bit differently.

Let's start with some metric-based analysis and insights (I will only be covering details from Muckrock data through 2019, as 97%
of my requestes were made through their platform):

* In 2019 I made **183 total FOIA requests** from my Muckrock account
* **41 of 183** or **22.4% of them were completed by the respective agency**
* **23 of the total records have not even received an acknowlegement** from the agency at hand
* Only **11 of the total request were outright rejected**
* I sent out **FOIAs to 106 different agencies** in total
* Only **9 of my 160 FOIAs with a response had a fee affiliated with them** - the largest single one being $374.98
* I've **been in lawsuits for 3 of my requests this year**, two local agencies and one federal

Most of my requests have pertained to law enforcemnt and other government technology I'm curious about - especially in order to shed light on surveillance tools
and programs. However I have also been interested in understanding some historical aspects of events and technical platforms this year.
For example, I am interested in ederal agency's perceptions and experience with open source operating systems. Some [responsive records](https://twitter.com/RooneyMcNibNug/status/1152327783055601664)
for a request I made with the FBI into documents on [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) revealed a peek into the investigation of a hack
committed against the operating system's concurrent version system and a vulnerability discovered in OpenSSH in the early 2000's.

In the less technical world, I have been in litigation with the FBI for records pertaining to former Chicago Police Commander Jon Burge, who 
was accussed by dozens of arrested citizens of torture leading to forced confessions. To this day, I am still [slowly receiving the over-5,000 pages
of records](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/united-states-of-america-10/foia-fbi-jon-burge-61298/) due from the request after paying the processing fee assigned.
