A big part of doing public records requests is the research before submitting the request.
For a lot of FOIAs I've filed, research has involved finding the relevant forms for the
question(s) I want to answer. 

This is where an agency's records retention policy can come in handy. Most public agencies
have either their own records retention policy and schedule or else they usually rely on an already 
established template/version from "above" (a federal version, perhaps). Regardless of the nature of the template, this 
schedule is created to lay out the expectations of how long the agency in question retains each document (forms!)
it is in charge of creating and maintaing. As FOIA is often an important tool used for requesting completed
forms, the agency's records retention schedule can help guide you on how far back they might have
copies of a particular form or other requestable document. It can also come in handy when an agency is refusing
to release documents past a certain time and wrongfully claiming they are not "kept" or "held" over a period
of time.

Fortunately, many agency websites and general .gov 
pages have links to these record retention policies handy (archives dot gov's 
[records schedules page](https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/rcs/schedules/index.html)
is good for this too). Unfortunately, it is hard to
find certain city or lower-level government agencies who's record may differ somewhat
from the other state records retention policies. Furthemore, these policy documents are
scattered all over the web - sometimes seemingly even not even publicly available.

As I have yet to see a pursuit dedicated to collecting and listing records retention 
policies through-out the United States on a "lower level", I've decided to start doing so 
[here](https://github.com/RooneyMcNibNug/FOIA/blob/master/Research/agency_records_retention_db.csv). 

I will continue building this table through a combination of scraping state agency webpages to find already publicly-facing records retention schedules and [sending FOIA requests](https://www.muckrock.com/foi/canton-25978/foia-stark-county-clerk-of-courts-oh-records-retention-schedule-78188/) for ones that are not so available.

I've created this table as a .csv, as to ensure portability, ease-of-revision, and the 
ability to filter or even ```grep``` whatever particular agency or other column data you 
might need.

If you are interested in freeing up a particular local agency's records retention schedule, feel
free to get in touch with me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/rooneymcnibnug) to request doing so
and I will see what I can do.

I am considering mirroring these webpages and creating copies of the hosted .pdfs of each schedule
eventually, in order to dump them in an archive of sorts.. but for now I will continue to build the 
table.
