A big part of doing public records requests is research beforehand. For a lot of
the FOIAs I've filed, research has involved finding the relevant forms for the
question(s) I want to answer. Fortunately, many agency websites and general .gov 
pages have links to these retention policies handy. Unfortunately, it is hard to
find certain city or lower-level government agencies who's record may differ somewhat
from the other state records retention policies.

As I have yet to find a pirsuit dedicated to collecting and listing records retention
policies through-out the United States, I've decided to start doing so here.
