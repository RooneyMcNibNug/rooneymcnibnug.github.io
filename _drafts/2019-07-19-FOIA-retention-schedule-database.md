A big part of doing public records requests is the research before FOIA submission. 
For a lot of FOIAs I've filed, research has involved finding the relevant forms for the
question(s) I want to answer. Fortunately, many agency websites and general .gov 
pages have links to these record retention policies handy (archives dot gov's 
[records schedules page](https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/rcs/schedules/index.html)
is good for this too. Unfortunately, it is hard to
find certain city or lower-level government agencies who's record may differ somewhat
from the other state records retention policies. Furthemore, these policy documents are
scattered all over the web - sometimes seemingly even not yet publicly available.

As I have yet to find a pursuit dedicated to collecting and listing records retention 
policies through-out the United States, I've decided to start doing so here.
