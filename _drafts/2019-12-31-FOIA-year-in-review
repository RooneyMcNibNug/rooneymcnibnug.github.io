# 2019's FOIAs - Year in Review and Reflections

This past year has definitely been the most active for me in regards to public records requests, so I thought I would spend a bit
of time on New Year's Eve to go over some of the details of my year with FOIA, some reflections of things that wen't well and things
I wish I'd done a bit differently.

Let's start with some metric-based analysis and insights (I will only be covering details from Muckrock data through 2019, as 97%
of my requestes were made through their platform):

* In 2019 on I made **184 total FOIA requests** from my Muckrock account
* **41 of 184** or **22.2% of them were completed by the respective agency**
