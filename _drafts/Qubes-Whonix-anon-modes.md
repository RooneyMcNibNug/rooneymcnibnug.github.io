# Automated Qubes AppVMs based on Whonix Anonymity Modes

I love QubesOS. I use it as a daily driver for a lot of things at this point, especially compartmentalized communications. A cluster of people I speak to use Qubes as well, so I often pick their brains about use cases, threat models, and what bells and whistles they've set up on their system.

I was speaking with one friend in particular about how they manage anonymization schemes with AppVMs, and they told me about how they rely on following guidelines put forth by Whonix in their wiki (located on the Whonix Anonymity Modes page). This idea makes a lot of sense to me, and I was eager to try it out.
