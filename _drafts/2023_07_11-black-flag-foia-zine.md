Back when I still had a twitter account I frequently shared responsive records to FOIAs I filed. Sometimes the response was crickets, but there were a few times where the records I got back were just too juicy to ignore.

Probably the most enjoyed ones were on the request I did looking for records mentioning the band Black Flag, which I filed with the FBI.

Among the responses, one that stood out to me was someone saying something along the lines of "Someone should make a Punk Zine going through these files and share it out."

Well, random twitter user, you did a great job in pitching an irresitable project - so much so that I have gone ahead and done this myself.
