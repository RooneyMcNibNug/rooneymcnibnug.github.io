# A Zine about Punk Music and FOIA

Back when I still had a twitter account I frequently shared responsive records from FOIAs I've filed. Sometimes the response was crickets (can't blame 'em!), but there were a few times where the records I got back were just too juicy to ignore.

Probably the most enjoyed records were results from a request I did looking for records mentioning the band Black Flag, which I filed with the FBI.

Among the responses to my tweets on those, one that stood out to me was someone saying something along the lines of "Someone should make a Punk Zine going through explaining these files"

Well, random twitter user, you did a great job in pitching an irresitable project - so much so that I have gone ahead and done this myself:

The short zine goes over a bit on the basics of FOIA, some history of Black Flag, and the nature of the FBI's quick investigation into the band, pertaining to an interview they gave on a popular California radio station.

Its a bit of a niche medium for FOIA, but I really enjoyed making this - so much so that I would be willing to do it again.

The PDF can be found on the Internet Archive [here](https://archive.org/details/it-feels-good-to-do-what-i-want), but I've also saved a copy of it within my FOIA repo on GitHub [here](https://github.com/RooneyMcNibNug/FOIA/blob/master/Responsive%20Docs/Black%20Flag/IT_FEELS_GOOD_TO_DO_WHAT_I_WANT.PDF).

You can view this on your favorite PDF viewer or browser, or if you prefer to print a physical copy, you can do so as long as you choose double-sided and booklet layouts for your print job:

I created this using a combination of [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/) and [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), which went very smoothly.

I miss going to shows and picking up zines dedicated to certain genres, bands, activism, etc.

Feel free to share this far and wide, or use it as inspiration to make your own Zine!
